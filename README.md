# The-Postcard-Project

The Postcard Project is a collaborative exchange between writers and theatre practitioners from Cape Town and students from CUNY, Queens College. 
The exchange forms part of the Year of South Africa at Queens College. It explores how public space in both cities possess multiple layers of meaning, functioning as palimpsests, 
hiding the original stories and being continually re-inscribed by contemporary readings.
  	
25 Cape Town artists were asked to photograph a space or place in Cape Town that struck them as interesting/ironic/stimulating/beautiful/problematic/sad, and to write a letter to accompany that postcard picture. 
The letter reveals the ‘story behind the image’, a story invisible at first glance, at least to someone with no context for the place in the picture. 
The postcards were delivered to 25 students at Queens College, who have responded with a space of their own in New York that mirrors, speaks back to or sits in conversation with the South African one.
 
The goal is to facilitate an ongoing conversation about how urban spaces are experienced by inhabitants of a city who know and experience a place beyond the ‘touristic’ image. 
This site is an archive of that exchange, a hopefully developing collection that highlights how cities on two different continents reflect and mirror one another.
