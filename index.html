  	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Postcard Project is a collaborative exchange between writers and theatre practitioners from Cape Town and students from CUNY, Queens College. 
  	The exchange forms part of the Year of South Africa at Queens College. It explores how public space in both cities possess multiple layers of meaning, functioning as palimpsests, 
  	hiding the original stories and being continually re-inscribed by contemporary readings.</p>
  	
  	<p>25 Cape Town artists were asked to photograph a space or place in Cape Town that struck them as interesting/ironic/stimulating/beautiful/problematic/sad, and to write a letter to accompany that postcard picture. 
  	The letter reveals the ‘story behind the image’, a story invisible at first glance, at least to someone with no context for the place in the picture. 
  	The postcards were delivered to 25 students at Queens College, who have responded with a space of their own in New York that mirrors, speaks back to or sits in conversation with the South African one.</p>
 
 	<p>The goal is to facilitate an ongoing conversation about how urban spaces are experienced by inhabitants of a city who know and experience a place beyond the ‘touristic’ image. 
 	This site is an archive of that exchange, a hopefully developing collection that highlights how cities on two different continents reflect and mirror one another.</p>

        This is an image of Columbus park also known as Five Points park. 
        It sits in the heart of one of the oldest residential areas in downtown Manhattan and was the very place where many of the first immigrants settled. 
        Acclaimed author Charles Dickens came to visit the park in 1842 and described it as “reeking everywhere with dirt and filth. 
        All that is loathsome, drooping and decayed is here.” 
        This park was once known as “murderers’ alley” and “the den of thieves” due to the enormous amount of gang violence that took place here. 
        Living conditions were unimaginably unhealthy and unsafe but these people had nowhere else to go. They were trying to start a new and better life in a new land. 
        Now, many years later, it is a place where children come to play and have fun. They have no idea that the very grounds they are stepping on have so much forgotten history.

        My photo seems like a simple movie theater: an empty street with no line of people waiting for a movie. 
        But recently the theater was busy with many helpful people from this community (Flushing, Queens). 
        This seemingly run down place is an independently run cinema that had been in business since 1927. 
        In more recent years the theater struggled to keep newer, popular movies showing and struggled to keep people coming to see the older movies. 
        As the theater was coming to its final days, they were able to play an extremely popular new movie (American Sniper) and urged the community to come and support them. 
        With the money raised, the theater is able to stay open and I feel like it sums up how a community can come together and save something with so much history.

        This is a picture of Stuyvesant Town in New York City. When I had this beautiful sight in front of me, I forgot the chaos of New York City. These are the moments of New York City that you take for granted because every day there's a new issue in the news about the city. I feel that this picture captures a moment that makes New Yorkers proud to be from here. On this very day my best friend and I walked this whole strip and just talked about everything in life: the good and the bad. We as New Yorkers usually donÕt take advantage of moments like this, and don't see the beauty in New York City anymore because of economic, financial, and social issues we face every day. But someway this picture captures a bit of hope for NYC.

        I am writing this as thanks for sending me a picture of the location where a shopping complex used to stand. I think that it is really sad that nothing has changed in 20 years. Your message was well written and it shows how the people claim that things will change but eventually they do not do anything. It is also amazing how the empty lot is known to everyone as a symbol for how much has remained the same and that people who say that they will bring forth change are probably lying. With this message I attached an image of the New York State Pavilion located in Flushing Meadows Park, Queens. The building in the picture is dirty, rusty, and empty. No one is allowed to go inside because the gates are closed. It used to be open about 50 years ago. People used to know what this building was but now only very few people who lived during that time know. In 1964 thousands of people used to come into the building to look at the beautifully carved out map of New York on the floor and the colorful roof that it used to have. Now it just stands there and is slowly falling apart. It would be great if they could open it because it used to be a great building.

        This photograph is of my sister feeding a baby goat in upstate New York, Catskills Mountains. My grandfather from Ireland loves to vacation in the Catskills because it reminds him of home with all the farm animals and beautiful mountain scenery. Even though my grandfather is not pictured in the photograph he is telling my younger sister and I about all the farm animals he had on his land and how he would get up early and milk the cows. It's a very special place for an Irish immigrant like himself to visit because it reminds him of all the memories from home. It also gives my sister and me good insight into what his childhood in Ireland was like.

        New York is commonly seen as a glorified city of prosperity and wealth; rarely is it seen as otherwise. Where this agreement ends, however, is on the state of living found amongst the poor. The poor face a large amount of fines, fees, and charges that aren't present for the wealth. These inconveniences keep the poor in an endless cycle in which the system keeps the poor, poor. As Terry Pratchett writes in his play, Men at Arms, "The reason that the rich were so rich...was because they managed to spend less money." He goes on to describe an example, which can apply to many situations, on buying a pair of boots. A wealthy man can buy a decent pair of boots that can last him around a year or two for about $50 while a poor man could only buy a pair of boots that would last him around two seasons for $10. Eventually the poor man would be spending more than the wealthy man a shoes alone. In this picture you see a group of poor people, maybe homeless, as seen all around New York. These people are trying to make ends meet by recycling bottles for as little as five cents: New York has a high cost of living.  Those homeless or poor can only vicariously live through the people they see around them.

        This is a beautiful landscape on a snowy day that I took when I was going home. At the moment I felt the weather and the environment around me was so pleasing. However, I slipped the day after because the street was so terrible to walk on. Also my class was canceled too.

        New York is usually viewed as a glorious place. The lights, food, and people portrayed as an amazing thing. But what is never seen are the people in need, people who had much and then had little. They are common here, usually at train stations asleep or on the sidewalk begging for money. This is my New York.
