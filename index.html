  <div id="description">
  	<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Postcard Project is a collaborative exchange between writers and theatre practitioners from Cape Town and students from CUNY, Queens College. 
  	The exchange forms part of the Year of South Africa at Queens College. It explores how public space in both cities possess multiple layers of meaning, functioning as palimpsests, 
  	hiding the original stories and being continually re-inscribed by contemporary readings.</p>
  	
  	<p>25 Cape Town artists were asked to photograph a space or place in Cape Town that struck them as interesting/ironic/stimulating/beautiful/problematic/sad, and to write a letter to accompany that postcard picture. 
  	The letter reveals the ‘story behind the image’, a story invisible at first glance, at least to someone with no context for the place in the picture. 
  	The postcards were delivered to 25 students at Queens College, who have responded with a space of their own in New York that mirrors, speaks back to or sits in conversation with the South African one.</p>
 
 	<p>The goal is to facilitate an ongoing conversation about how urban spaces are experienced by inhabitants of a city who know and experience a place beyond the ‘touristic’ image. 
 	This site is an archive of that exchange, a hopefully developing collection that highlights how cities on two different continents reflect and mirror one another.</p>

        This is an image of Columbus park also known as Five Points park. 
        It sits in the heart of one of the oldest residential areas in downtown Manhattan and was the very place where many of the first immigrants settled. 
        Acclaimed author Charles Dickens came to visit the park in 1842 and described it as “reeking everywhere with dirt and filth. 
        All that is loathsome, drooping and decayed is here.” 
        This park was once known as “murderers’ alley” and “the den of thieves” due to the enormous amount of gang violence that took place here. 
        Living conditions were unimaginably unhealthy and unsafe but these people had nowhere else to go. They were trying to start a new and better life in a new land. 
        Now, many years later, it is a place where children come to play and have fun. They have no idea that the very grounds they are stepping on have so much forgotten history.

        My photo seems like a simple movie theater: an empty street with no line of people waiting for a movie. 
        But recently the theater was busy with many helpful people from this community (Flushing, Queens). 
        This seemingly run down place is an independently run cinema that had been in business since 1927. 
        In more recent years the theater struggled to keep newer, popular movies showing and struggled to keep people coming to see the older movies. 
        As the theater was coming to its final days, they were able to play an extremely popular new movie (American Sniper) and urged the community to come and support them. 
        With the money raised, the theater is able to stay open and I feel like it sums up how a community can come together and save something with so much history.
